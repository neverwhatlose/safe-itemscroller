Item Scroller
==============
Item Scroller is a Minecraft mod that adds various convenience features for moving items
inside inventory GUIs. Examples are scrolling the mouse wheel over slots with items in them
or Shift/Ctrl + click + dragging over slots to move items from them in various ways etc.

Item scrolling is basically what the old NEI mod did and Mouse Tweaks also does.

THIS FORK HAS SOME CHANGES:
- removed Villagers Utils

This mod has some different drag features compared to Mouse Tweaks, and also some special crafting helper features.
